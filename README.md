# Phil's Netrunner Legacy Decks (https://netrunnerlegacy.herokuapp.com)

## Background

I absolutely love Android: Netrunner, a cyberpunk themed asymmetric Living Card Game (LCG) from publisher Fantasy Flight Games (FFG). It had multiple interesting factions with a myriad of different deck archtypes to try and build decks for. The dystopian theme and atmosphere this game created was absolutely top notch and it absorbed me into its world. It felt like *I* was actually hacking into servers and stealing valuable information, that *I* was a mega corporation installing giant cyber defenses in order to advance my own agendas while keeping nosey hackers at bay or (to the dismay of the runner) flatlining them.

## Motivation

Unfortunately for a lot of people, on June 8, 2018, after 6 incredible years of production, the game was officially discontinued due to the license ending with Wizards of the Coast. 

As one does when a game you've played for so long ends, you do things that you can to keep the game alive for as long as you can. I built this website, along with all the decklists presented in them, as a way for me to introduce newcomers and sway veterans to continue playing the game.
