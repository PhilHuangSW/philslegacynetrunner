  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="6" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="6id0">Omar</a> is an old school runner with some new tricks. There is nothing super flashy about
  his style, everything is just solid from his experience.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Deep digging when <a class="17" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="17e5">Surging</a> your <a class="14" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="14p3">Mediums</a> and <a class="16" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="16p4">Nerve Agents</a>. Icebreaker destruction is not a factor when they can be brought back from
  the heap
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; No reliable economy package, can be slow to build back up after a virus purging
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="6" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="6id0">Omar</a> can definitely surprise the corp with how explosive he can get. One clean <a
    class="7" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="7e0">Frantic Coding</a> session and
  he's off to the races. An ideal hit would be <a class="3" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="3i0">Paperclip</a>, <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="5i1"
    class="5">Black Orchestra</a>, <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="8i2"
    class="8">MKUltra</a>, <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14p3"
    class="14">Medium</a>, and <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="16p4"
    class="16">Nerve Agent</a> chucked into the bin with a <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="9e1" class="9">Deja Vu</a> to bring back <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="14p3" class="14">Medium</a> and <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="16p4" class="16">Nerve Agent</a>; the icebreakers can bring themselves back into play with their
  ability.
  <br>
  Once everything is setup, just run either HQ or R&D and <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="17e5" class="17">Surge</a> the respective viruses to get massive accesses.
  <br>
  One of the best things about running with <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="6id0" class="6">Omar</a> is that you can learn how to be a smarter runner by being reckless. After
  you have <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="0r0" class="0">Street Magic</a> out,
  or a couple of your icebreakers are installed/in the bin, you can just freely run into ICE and seeing that, while
  scary initially, ICE aren't really <em>that</em> harmful.
  <br>
  The only real problem with <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="6id0"
    class="6">Omar</a> is that he doesn't have a reliable credit engine. You can do yourself a favor though by <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="11e3" class="11">Stimhacking</a> into a server
  with ICE that allows you to bring back your icebreakers from the heap.

<p>
  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Look for a <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="7e0" class="7">Frantic Coding</a> and <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="9e1" class="9">Deja Vu</a> in your opening hand, it can get you set up pretty much from turn 1.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; Don't be afraid to use both of your <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="7e0" class="7">Frantic Codings</a>, with the help of <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="20p5" class="20">Trope</a> and <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="9e1" class="9">Deja Vu</a>, you should be able to just bring back any
  piece(s) you need.
