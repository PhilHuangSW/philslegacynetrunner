  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="5" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="5id0">Chaos Theory</a> was one of my favorite runners when she was first introduced. It
  was rare to find an ID with a minimum decklist of 40 cards at that time. Her passive ability to have an extra
  MU will be used very well with her rig!
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Huge breaker suite and near endless economy
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Slow to setup, everything is expensive
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; To make use of her extra MU, we've brought in the best Icebreakers that
  utilize extra Memory. <a class="3" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="3i1">Savant</a> and <a class="2" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="2i0">Adept</a> along with the incredible
  <a class="14" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14i2">Overmind</a> will
  allow you to
  break pretty much
  any ICE you encounter. Hosting all your programs
  onto <a class="4" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4p0">Dhegdheers</a> and
  <a class="8" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="8h1">Dinosaurus</a> will
  ensure you have the maximum
  strength/counters for your Icebreakers.
  <br>
  The downfall to this deck is definitely in the setup. Everything is quite costly to build and the economy
  package, while good, can take a little while to get going. If the corp catches on and can out-tempo you by
  advancing agendas before you can get set up, it can sometimes be difficult to mount a comeback.
  <br>
  Take your first couple of turns setting up your economy. Appear weak and have the corp threaten to advance out
  an agenda. All you need is a <a class="11" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="11p2">Self-modifying Code</a>/<a class="14" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="14i2">Overmind</a> to easily break through and steal
  agendas. Once you have tempo back on your side, continue to economy up.

  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Try to look for <a class="14" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="14i2">Overmind</a>, <a class="9" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="9p1">Magnum Opus</a>, or
  <a class="11" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="11p2">Self-modifying
    Code</a>
  with some economy as a starting hand. Don't be afraid of using all your cards if you have
  a <a class="16" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="16e6">Game Day</a> in
  your hand, easy refuel and helps with <a class="12" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="12e4">Power Naps</a>!
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; Ideal rig would consist of <a class="9" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="9p1">Magnum
    Opus</a> and <a class="2" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="2i0">Adept</a> or <a
    class="3" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="3i1">Savant</a> onto <a class="4"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4p0">Dhegdheers</a> with the
  other on <a class="8" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="8h1">Dinosaurus</a>, 3x <a
    class="1" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="1h0">LLDS Memory Diamond</a> and 3x
  <a class="15" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="15r0">Data
    Folding</a> for a total of 9-12 strength breakers with 3
  credits at start of turn, and endless econ using <a class="9" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="9p1">Magnum
    Opus</a>.
