  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="5 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="5id0">Chaos Theory</a> is a clever girl, a <em>wunderkind</em>. She is the classic big Shaper
  build; powerful icebreakers along with great ways to generate credits. She utilizes MU as a weapon rather than just
  space for programs.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Huge breaker suite and a literal <a class="9 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="9p1">printer of credits</a>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Slow to setup, everything is expensive
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; To make use of her passive, we've incorporated all the Icebreakers that do well with
  large amounts of MU. <a class="3 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="3i1">Savant</a>
  and <a class="2 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="2i0">Adept</a> along
  with the
  incredible
  <a class="14 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14i2">Overmind</a> will
  allow you to
  break pretty much
  any ICE you encounter. Hosting all your programs
  onto <a class="4 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4p0">Dhegdheers</a>
  and
  <a class="8 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="8h1">Dinosaurus</a> will
  ensure you have the maximum
  strength/counters for your Icebreakers.
  <br>
  The downfall to this deck is definitely in the setup. Everything is quite costly to build and the economy
  package, while endless, can take a little while to get going. If the corp catches on and can out-tempo you by
  advancing agendas before you can get set up, it can sometimes be difficult to mount a comeback.
  <br>
  Take your first couple of turns setting up your economy. Once the corp threatens to advance out
  an agenda, all you need is a <a class="11 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="11p2">Self-modifying Code</a>/<a class="14 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14i2">Overmind</a> to easily break through and steal
  agendas. Allowing the corp to score a couple of agendas is okay, just be on the lookout for a timely <a
    class="0 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="0e0">Deep Data Mining</a>
  run to put a lock on
  R&D.

  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Try to look for <a class="14 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14i2">Overmind</a> or
  <a class="11 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="11p2">Self-modifying
    Code</a>
  with some economy such as <a class="13 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="13e5">Lucky Find</a> or <a class="15 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="15r0">Data Foldings</a>.

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; Ideal rig would consist of <a class="9 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="9p1">Magnum
    Opus</a> and <a class="2 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="2i0">Adept</a>/<a class="3 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="3i1">Savant</a> onto <a class="4 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="4p0">Dhegdheers</a> with the
  other on <a class="8 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="8h1">Dinosaurus</a>. Don't
  be afraid to install programs/icebreakers for fear of using your MU if it means pressuring the corp. Just <a
    class="10 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="10e3">Scavenge</a> it later
  onto a
  <a class="4 iosModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4p0">Dhegdheer</a> to free
  up that
  space!
