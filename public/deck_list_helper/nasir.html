  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="23" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="23id0">Nasir</a> is a pretty weird runner. He has a lot of tools at his disposal, but finding the
  right one for the job can sometimes take a little while. Time is his best friend though, at least when it comes to
  working in
  his <a class="10" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="10r0">Personal Workshop</a>.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Free economy with his ID, has
  a tool for almost every situation
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Econ is extremely swingy and unpredictable, smart ICE
  placement can completely lock you out of a server
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; The <em>most</em> important card in this deck is the <a class="10"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="10r0">Personal Workshop</a>. Once you have it
  online (or multiple
  online), just chuck all your hardware and programs onto it. Then all you need to do is run headstrong into corp ICE to
  trigger your ability for free money!
  <br>
  The way it works is before your ability kicks in, you have a timing window to spend all your credits into <a
    class="10" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="10r0">Personal Workshop</a>
  supplies, then once you're done spending as much as you can, trigger your ability for easy money.
  <br>
  <a class="28" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="28i6">Chameleon</a> will be your
  first icebreaker to look for to place onto the workshop. It is flexible for you in breaking whatever you encounter.
  Pair that with 3x <a class="21" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="21h6">LLDS
    Processors</a> and that's a 6 strength icebreaker of your choice! With the help of <a class="14"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14h2">Replicator</a>, you should have no
  problem installing all your processors when needed the most.
  <br>
  <a class="15" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="15r1">Kati Jones</a> will be
  another key piece for your economy. Getting free credits from the workshop and your ID, while nice, is sometimes
  unpredictable. Kati will help keep you healthy in credits when the corp has rezzed a low cost ICE that empties your
  credit pool.

  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Hard mull for <a class="10" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="10r0">Personal Workshop</a> and <a class="15" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="15r1">Kati Jones</a>. They are the 2 most important pieces in the deck and having them are vital
  to <a class="23" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="23id0">Nasir's</a> success
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="11" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="11p3">Crescentus</a> and <a class="9" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="9e1">Emergency Shutdown</a> are incredible cards to help you take more advantage of <a class="23"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="23id0">Nasir's</a> ability.
  <br>
  Using <a class="26" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="26r3">London Library</a> on
  <a class="28" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="28i6">Chameleons</a> are a great
  way to save on 2 credits when money is tight. Due to the timing structure, you'll be able to pull <a class="28"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="28i6">Chameleons</a> back into
  your hand before having to trash it from <a class="26" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="26r3">London Library's</a> effect.
