  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="1id0"
    class="1 iosModal">Weyland Consortium</a> is one of the most openly brutal mega corporations in all of netrunner.
  They build <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="22is2"
    class="22 iosModal">giant</a> <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="23ib5"
    class="23 iosModal">constellations</a> of <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="21ic3" class="21 iosModal">ICE</a> to ensure runners can't touch their secrets, but in the cases
  where the runner
  gets lucky, there are always <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="15o5"
    class="15 iosModal">countermeasures</a> to ensure none of it gets to the public.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Easy chip damage, strong advanceable ICE
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Slow gameplay, spending credits and clicks to advance ICE means not advancing
  agendas
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="1id0"
    class="1 iosModal">Weyland</a> definitely prefers a slower and longer playstyle. The deck only contains 8 agendas,
  so a lot of your turns will just be to simply build up your advanceable ICE until the runner cannot penetrate your
  defenses.
  <br>
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="15o5" class="15 iosModal">Punitive
    Counterstrike</a> can sometimes win you the game if the runner isn't careful enough. By taking damage from your <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="1id0" class="1 iosModal">ID</a>, if they
  accidentally steal one too many agendas, it might lead to a flatlined runner if you have counterstrike in hand.
  <br>
  Even after advancements have been placed, you can still use <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="10o3" class="10 iosModal">Trick of Light</a> and <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="12o4" class="12 iosModal">Commercialization</a> to benefit from the
  lost clicks and credits sunk into the ICE investment.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Try to look for an <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="9ib1" class="9 iosModal">Ice Wall</a> to hide agendas behind. Being able to score a <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14ag0" class="14 iosModal">Cleaners</a> turn
  3-4 can severely hinder the runners progress and gameplan.

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; Use <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="2a0"
    class="2 iosModal">Anson Rose</a> on the likes of <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="13ib2" class="13 iosModal">Tyrant</a> and <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="11is1" class="11 iosModal">Woodcutter</a> to immediately make use of their subroutines once
  rezzed.
  <br>
  Don't be afraid of using <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="15o5"
    class="15 iosModal">Punitive Counterstrike</a> even if it doesn't flatline the runner. Stopping their rig building
  process can allow you to score behind your beefy ICE.
  <br>
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="19a1" class="19 iosModal">Space Camp</a>
  triggers from anywhere (even Archives!), so make sure to always trigger it when it has been accessed.
  <br>
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="13ib2" class="13 iosModal">Tyrant</a> and <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="11is1" class="11 iosModal">Woodcutter</a> are
  the only ICE that <em>cannot</em> be advanced when unrezzed, every other piece of ICE <em>is</em> advanceable. Make
  use of this
  to trigger your <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="1id0"
    class="1 iosModal">ID</a> as much as possible!
