  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="16id0"
    class="16 iosModal">The Foundry</a> is a division of Haas-Bioroid that mines the materials needed to create
  bioroids. Though they don't use bioroids themselves, they make use of their NEXT line (<a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="11ic0" class="11 iosModal">Bronze</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14ib0" class="14 iosModal">Silver</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="22is1" class="22 iosModal">Gold</a>) of ICE, as well as the Grail
  line (<a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="15ib1" class="15 iosModal">Galahad</a> -
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="17is0" class="17 iosModal">Lancelot</a> - <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="20io0" class="20 iosModal">Excalibur</a> - <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="19ic1" class="19 iosModal">Merlin</a>) of ICE
  to protect their assets. While there are many clearance levels (<a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="8o3" class="8 iosModal">Green</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="12o4" class="12 iosModal">Blue</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="3o1" class="3 iosModal">Ultraviolet</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="4u0" class="4 iosModal">Black</a>) when stationed at <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="16id0" class="16 iosModal">The Foundry</a>, you
  luckily, possess all of them.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Strong potential to flatline the runner, click efficient clearance cards to get you
  cards and credits
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; NEXT line requires multiple to become a threat, potential to overdraw when using
  clearance cards
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="16id0"
    class="16 iosModal">The Foundry</a> has a lot of cool synergy with its ICE package. The entire NEXT line benefits
  each other the more rezzed NEXT ICE there are, while the Grail line benefits each other when some are kept in HQ. Not
  only does the ID ability benefit your defenses, it also helps to filter through your deck when using clearance cards
  to draw.
  <br>
  The glacier style (having a large remote server with lots of ICE) is very prevalent here, but it's not the only way in
  which to win. Through the use of <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="7u1"
    class="7 iosModal">Corporate Troubleshooter</a> and <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="21u2" class="21 iosModal">The Twins</a>, you can set up a flatline situation when a runner runs
  into a <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="22is1" class="22 iosModal">NEXT
    Gold</a> or any of the Grail ICE with <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="19ic1"
    class="19 iosModal">Merlin(s)</a> kept in HQ.
  <br>
  If the runner runs into an advanced <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="10a1"
    class="10 iosModal">Cerebral Overwriter</a>, it makes the flatline potential even greater and causes hesitation and
  caution during their future runs. Make use of this hesitation by further scoring agendas while they take clicks to
  catch up.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Try to look for NEXT <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="11ic0" class="11 iosModal">Bronze</a> or <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="14ib0" class="14 iosModal">Silver</a> to shore up early vulnerabilites, <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="23a2" class="23 iosModal">Cybernetics Court</a> to prevent overdraw
  from clearance cards.
  <br>
  Alternatively, you can try to set up a turn 1-2 flatline when a <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="19ic1" class="19 iosModal">Merlin</a> (ideally 2) show up in your starting hand.

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="0a0"
    class="0 iosModal">Jeeves</a> works well with your clearance cards. When spending a click or clicks to play
  operations, if
  a total of 3 clicks were spent, <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="0a0"
    class="0 iosModal">Jeeves</a> will trigger to gain you an extra click. That means even if you just play a single <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="3o1" class="3 iosModal">Ultraviolet
    Clearance</a>, <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="0a0"
    class="0 iosModal">Jeeves</a> will trigger.
  <br>
  Always be on the look out for a potential flatline, but don't make that your first priority. Do so when the
  opportunity presents itself while still advancing your agendas. This puts more pressure on the runner which often
  leads to more mistakes, ultimately leading to an easier flatline scenario.
