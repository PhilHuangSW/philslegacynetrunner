  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="7id0"
    class="7 iosModal">Spark Agency</a> is part of NBN, the mega corporation that controls the world's media. Spark
  acquires its talents and rapidly spreads ads and news so as to get you to purchase immediately. They want to make sure
  you use your credits on their products, and not on programs that hack into their database.

<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Lots of ways of draining the runner of their credits
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Not the strongest ICE, <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="7id0" class="7 iosModal">ID</a> can only trigger once per turn
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="7id0"
    class="7 iosModal">Spark</a> is all about economy denial; a broke runner (usually) means safe servers. A lot of your
  assets both gain you credits as well as drain their credits. By rezzing an <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="5a3" class="5 iosModal">Adonis Campaign</a> (or any other
  advertisement) at the end of the runner's turn, you simultaneously trigger your <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="7id0" class="7 iosModal">ID</a> as well as enter your turn with the
  drip economy running. This credit swing (although initially slow), can force the runner into difficult or unexpected
  decisions.
  <br>
  Agendas such as <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="17ag1"
    class="17 iosModal">NAPD Contract</a>, <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="25ag4" class="25 iosModal">15 Minutes</a>, and <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="22ag4" class="22 iosModal">Explode-a-palooza</a> can be beneficial to
  you when the runner scores them. Placing them out in new naked remotes alongside some ad campaigns can throw off the
  runner off their gameplan.
  <br>
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="10u1" class="10 iosModal">SanSan City Grid</a>
  is one of your most powerful tools to win. Placing one alongside another facedown card really puts the runner in a
  pickle; do they run through that server (hopefully being protected by a <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="9ic0" class="9 iosModal">Tollbooth</a>) to catch the agenda, or have
  they wasted credits by running straight into another ad campaign? Not only that, it's extremely expensive to trash and
  will usually give you another opportunity to score when the runner does decide to trash it.

  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Mull for <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="10u1" class="10 iosModal">SanSan City Grids</a> alongside ICE and ad campaigns.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; Once <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="26ag5"
    class="26 iosModal">Rebranding Team</a> has been scored, <em>all</em> assets have the advertisement tag, so <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="29o1" class="29 iosModal">Ad Blitz</a> and your
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="7id0" class="7 iosModal">ID</a> can target any
  asset.
  <br>
  Make use of the "first time each turn" of your <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="7id0" class="7 iosModal">ID</a>, that is to say you can rez an advertisement on your turn, force
  the runner to lose a credit, then rez another advertisement on the runner's turn to force them to lose another credit.
  <br>
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="23a9" class="23 iosModal">Early Premiere</a>
  will help you score out a 4/2 if you placed an agenda to look like an ad campaign. Read what the runner will do, and
  test your limits!
