  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="3id0"
    class="3 iosModal">Jinteki</a> are the corporation responsible for mass clone production as well as specializing in
  precog (the ability to see the future before it happens). Though the stopping force of their ICE compared to other
  corporations are weak, they specialize in <em>hurting</em> the runner when trespassing into their servers.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Lots of ways to deal damage to the runner
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Little and few ICE, traps don't (usually) trigger from R&D digs
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="3id0"
    class="3 iosModal">Jinteki's</a> playstyle is very different from other corporations. Their playstyle is all about
  the shell game; placing out assets/agendas and daring the runner to run into them. Because of their <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="3id0" class="3 iosModal">ID</a>, even if the
  runner scores agendas, they'll still feel the hurt.
  <br>
  The basic game plan is to set out remotes and slowly advance either agendas or traps and just hope for the best. There
  are a lot of mind games involved when playing <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="3id0" class="3 iosModal">Jinteki</a>, and being able to read whether your opponent will run into
  traps is a vital skill to have.
  <br>
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="25o5" class="25 iosModal">Mushin No Shin</a>
  is exactly the kind of card that can make the runner sweat. Use it on a <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14a3" class="14 iosModal">Ronin</a> to easily be able to use its
  ability, on a <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4a1" class="4 iosModal">Project
    Junebug</a> to potentially deal 6 net damage, or on a <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="21a7" class="21 iosModal">GRNDL Refinery</a> to get you a burst of much needed credits.
  <br>
  Use <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="12o4" class="12 iosModal">Trick of
    Light</a> to be able to advance out agendas from hand when a trap has failed to lure a runner in.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; There's nothing really necessary for your starting hand, but having a <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="9o3" class="9 iosModal">Hedge Fund</a> can
  really help make traps scary for the runner. You can also try to look for a <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="22ag4" class="22 iosModal">House of Knives</a> or <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="16ag3" class="16 iosModal">Gila Hands
    Arcology</a> and play a shell game with some traps and hope they don't run it. Being able to score one of those on
  turn 2 can really help improve your mid game.

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; Try to stay above 4 credits when playing as <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="3id0" class="3 iosModal">Jinteki</a> since this is the amount you need
  to trigger <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="5a2" class="5 iosModal">Snares!</a>
  A broke <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="3id0" class="3 iosModal">Jinteki</a>
  is a dinosaur with no teeth. Traps (usually) require credits to activate, so being at 0 means they can run what would
  have been threatening servers and trash the traps without suffering the consequences.
  <br>
  Try to set up flatline situations by advancing threatening agendas such as <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="23ag5" class="23 iosModal">Philotic Entanglement</a> and <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="1ag0" class="1 iosModal">Show of Force</a> and
  acting like they were failed traps if the runner chooses not to run them. Scoring out a <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="1ag0" class="1 iosModal">Show of Force</a> by itself nets you 2 agenda
  points, while simultaneously dealing 3 damage to the runner. If you had a <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14a3" class="14 iosModal">Ronin</a> already advanced, you can flatline
  the runner dealing a total of 6 damage.
