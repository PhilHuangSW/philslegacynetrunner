  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="iosModal 7" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="7id0">Gabe</a> is the consummate professional, he knows just about everyone, and everyone knows
  him. He is the John Wick of Netrunner, with his favorite icebreaker being the very fitting, all-powerful <a
    class="iosModal 4" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a>.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Has connections that get him lots of credits, <a class="iosModal 4"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a> can be unstoppable at a
  certain point
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Lots of 1-ofs make the deck inconsistent, <a class="iosModal 4"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a> must be installed before
  other icebreakers
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; Playing this deck is kind of like going through the John Wick movies. Meeting a
  whole bunch of connections to get you through rough patches while digging up all your icebreakers to then shoot up all
  the corp's ICE.
  <br>
  Both <a class="iosModal 4" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a> and
  <a class="iosModal 28" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="28r14">Off-Campus
    Apartment</a>
  play very similarly. Both of them will require you to install them first before your other icebreakers/resources.
  The more icebreakers on <a class="iosModal 4" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba
    Yaga</a>, the deadlier and more efficient it becomes. <a class="iosModal 28" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="28r14">Off-Campus Apartment</a> is there to help get things rolling
  faster.
  <br>
  It is imperative to host all of your icebreakers onto <a class="iosModal 4" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a>. Your central-only icebreakers (<a
    class="iosModal 23" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="23i4">Breach</a> - <a
    class="iosModal 24" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="24i5">Passport</a>) allow
  you to use their paid abilities
  <em>without</em> the
  central-only restriction, <a class="iosModal 11" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="11i2">Faerie</a> isn't trashed after a single use, and <a class="iosModal 14"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14i3">Yog.0</a> can actually be pumped up to
  strength.

  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Hard mull for <a class="iosModal 4" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a> and <a class="iosModal 28" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="28r14">Off-Campus Apartment</a>. If you start with one and have either
  <a class="iosModal 8" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="8e0">Hostage</a> and/or <a
    class="iosModal 9" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="9e1">Special Order</a>, that
  is a good keep as
  well.

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="iosModal 8" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="8e0">Hostage</a> targets include <a class="iosModal 3" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="3r3">Beth Kilrain-Chang</a>, <a class="iosModal 18"

  hosted on <a class="iosModal 4" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba
    Yaga</a> and <a class="iosModal 20" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="20h1">Silencers</a> are the best way to get up
  to strength while only using <em>1</em> credit.
