  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="8" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="8id0">Gabe</a> is the consummate professional, he knows just about everyone, and everyone knows
  him. He is the John Wick of Netrunner, with his favorite icebreaker being the very fitting, all-powerful <a class="4"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a>.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; For a Criminal, he has an incredible breaker suite if installed onto <a class="4"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a>. With all his connections,
  he has a lot of ways to gain credits, and sometimes even clicks
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; For being so reputable, <a class="8" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="8id0">Gabe</a> takes a while to set up. While <a class="4"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a> is incredible, it requires
  all of its supporting cast installed on to it in order for it to be the killing machine it's known for
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; Playing this deck is kind of like going through the John Wick movies. Meeting a
  whole bunch of connections to get you through rough patches while digging up all your icebreakers to then shoot up all
  the corp's ICE.
  <br>
  Both <a class="4" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a> and <a
    class="28" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="28r15">Off-Campus Apartment</a>
  play very similarly. Both of them will require you to install them first before your other icebreakers/resources.
  The more icebreakers on <a class="4" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba
    Yaga</a>, the deadlier and more efficient it becomes. <a class="28" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="28r15">Off-Campus Apartment</a> is there to help get things rolling
  faster.
  <br>
  It is important to know that all of your central-only icebreakers (<a class="21" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="21i4">Alias</a> - <a class="22" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="22i5">Breach</a> - <a class="23" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="23i6">Passport</a>) placed onto <a class="4" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a> will allow <a class="4" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a> to use their abilities <em>without</em> the
  central-only restriction! This makes for very efficient breaking at the cost of finding all the pieces in the right
  order.

  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Hard mull for <a class="4" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="4i0">Baba Yaga</a> and <a class="28" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="28r15">Off-Campus Apartment</a>. If you start with one and have either <a class="9"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="9e0">Hostage</a> and/or <a class="10"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="10e1">Special Order</a>, that is a good keep as
  well.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="9" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="9e0">Hostage</a> targets include <a class="3" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="3r3">Beth Kilrain-Chang</a>, <a class="15" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="15r7">Kati Jones</a>, <a class="25" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="25r12">The Supplier</a>, and <a class="26" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="26r13">Rachel Beckman</a> (once one of your <a class="17" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="17r8">Decoys</a> has been set up).
