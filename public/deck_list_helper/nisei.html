  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="21id0"
    class="21 iosModal">Nisei</a> is a division of Jinteki responsible for precognitive clones, their most famous being
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="20u0" class="20 iosModal">Caprice Nisei</a>.
  Their precog abilities are represented by the PSI game; by correctly guessing what the runner is going to do, <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="21id0" class="21 iosModal">Nisei</a> will be
  able to properly prepare for the attack and prevent further infiltration.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Lots of ways to damage the runner, built-in protection on some agendas
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Must be able to win PSI games to be effective, lots of porous ICE
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="21id0"
    class="21 iosModal">Nisei's</a> playstyle is all about the PSI game. There's a lot of different ways to damage the
  runner (<a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="8a2" class="8 iosModal">Snare!</a> -
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="18a5" class="18 iosModal">Shock!</a> - <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="6a1" class="6 iosModal">Fumiko Yamamori</a>),
  but the main goal is not to flatline the runner. Being able to damage the runner to slow down their rig building is
  essential, and in the off chance they do make it through your dangerous ICE, <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="20u0" class="20 iosModal">Caprice Nisei</a> will be there to stop a
  full access if you can win the PSI game.
  <br>
  Make the runner fear what is behind servers backed up with damaging ICE. If they end up with a near-empty hand, they
  might think twice on accessing what could be a killing blow.
  <br>
  A lot of assets are very costly to trash for the runner (<a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="4a0" class="4 iosModal">Hyoubu Research Facility</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="30a7" class="30 iosModal">Genetics Pavilion</a> - <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="6a1" class="6 iosModal">Fumiko Yamamori</a>),
  but they are almost necessary to trash if they don't want you to run away with the game.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Try to search for an early End the Run ICE (<a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="11ib0" class="11 iosModal">Wall of Thorns</a> - <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="16ib2" class="16 iosModal">Himitsu-Bako</a>);
  there aren't a lot of them in the deck and having them early to attempt to score agendas is very helpful.
</p>

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; The first <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="22ag1"
    class="22 iosModal">Medical Breakthrough</a> is almost better if the runner steals it from you as that makes your
  future one a 3/2 and the last one a 2/2. Sometimes installing into 3 new naked remotes can really scare a runner to
  see what's behind each door, try to take advantage of this hesitation. It's all about reading people!
