  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="19id0"
    class="19">Adam</a> is just searching for his way. He was programmed to be a Netrunner along with his Three
  Directives (<a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="26r6" class="26">Safety
    First</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="23r3" class="23">Always Be
    Running</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="25r5" class="25">Neutralize
    All Threats</a>), but, why? With the help and guidance of some powerful Deva AI, his goal is to find out, all the
  while
  being
  compulsed to hack.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Powerful AI icebreakers, a plethora of recurring credits for icebreakers and events
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Must follow his initial Three Directives which can force you into awkward
  situations
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="19id0"
    class="19">Adam</a> is great to build your running skills as it forces you to do and play out of your comfort
  zone, developing good practices as a runner in general.
  <br>
  First Directive: <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="26r6" class="26">Safety
    First</a> seems like a pretty big set back, but being able to draw a card every turn for free essentially is
  <em>insane</em>. Once you have <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="21h3"
    class="21">Brain Chip</a> installed and a couple agendas stolen, the drawback to <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="26r6" class="26">Safety First</a> is straight nullified, while still
  having the awesome draw engine all game.
  <br>
  Second Directive: <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="23r3" class="23">Always Be
    Running</a> is definitely terrifying for a beginner runner, but you'll find through experience, running into ICE
  with no breakers isn't so bad. Most of the consequences you handle in the early game can be dealt with crediting back
  up or drawing back up. Being able to break <em>any</em> ICE subroutine for just two clicks is awesome and will force
  the corp to have to install more ICE to defend against your constant onslaught.
  <br>
  Third Directive: <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="25r5" class="25">Neutralize
    All Threats</a> is almost always good. You'll <em>want</em> to trash all of the corps' cards anyway, so being able
  to access an additional card in HQ is all upside for you. It also only works for the first card with a trash cost, so
  anything you access afterward, you don't need to trash it if it's too damaging.
  <br>
  Now with the Directives accounted for, you'll want to have all of your recurring credits set up (<a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="22p0" class="22">Multithreader</a> - <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="7h0" class="7">Cyberfeeder</a> - <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="15h2" class="15">Prepaid VoicePAD</a>) then
  just run using all of your AI icebreakers. <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="24r4" class="24">Dr. Lovegood</a> is there to patch you up in case you <em>really</em> can't
  afford to follow one of your Directives.

  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Hard mull for <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="21h3" class="21">Brain Chip</a>.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; Using <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="2i2"
    class="2">Brahman</a> after all of your <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="18i4" class="18">Overmind</a> power counters are spent is the best way to utilize <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="18i4" class="18">Overmind</a> over and over
  again.
