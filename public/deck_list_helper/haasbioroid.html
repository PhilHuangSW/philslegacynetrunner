  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="6id0"
    class="6 iosModal">Haas-Bioroid</a> is <em>the</em> corporation that created the bioroids; androids built with
  cybernetic technology with artificially-intelligent minds designed around sophisticated imaging of human brains.
  They've made an enormous amount of money by exploiting cheap android labor and by constantly pushing bioroid campaigns
  to the public.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Efficient strength/cost ratio on ICE through their ability, strong drip economy by
  pushing campaigns
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; All ICE are bioroids which can be broken with remaining clicks, economy requires
  time to receive
</p>

  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="6id0"
    class="6 iosModal">Haas-Bioroid</a> is classic glacier; that is you build large servers with lots of ICE, then score
  behind the wall of ICE. With the <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="12a1"
    class="12 iosModal">numerous</a> <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="19a3"
    class="19 iosModal">amounts</a> of <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="22a4"
    class="22 iosModal">different</a> <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="15a2"
    class="15 iosModal">campaigns</a>, it is an absolute chore for runners to run each campaign and pay the high trash
  cost to get rid of them.
  <br>
  Spend the early game shoring up your servers with ICE while hopefully making use of your <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="6id0" class="6 iosModal">ID</a>. Putting out all sorts of
  campaigns presents a catch-22 for the runner; will they spend clicks and credits to trash them or allow you to slowly
  gain a credit advantage as time goes on. Once you have established a healthy credit pool, your general path to victory
  will be to keep scoring behind a 2+ ICED up server.

  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Your ideal hand would contain a couple of campaigns (<a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="12a1" class="12 iosModal">Marilyn</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="15a2" class="15 iosModal">Adonis</a>) with some fairly cheap bioroids
  (<a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="23ib2" class="23 iosModal">Eli 1.0</a> - <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="3ic1" class="3 iosModal">Fairchild 1.0</a>) to
  snowball into stronger bioroids (<a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="17ib1"
    class="17 iosModal">Heimdall 1.0</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="7ic4"
    class="7 iosModal">Fairchild</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="27is3"
    class="27 iosModal">Ichi 2.0</a>) through your <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="6id0" class="6 iosModal">ID</a>.

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; Use <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="16o1"
    class="16 iosModal">Biotic Labor</a> to score 3 advancement agendas (<a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="10ag1" class="10 iosModal">Sensor Net Activation</a> - <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="21ag2" class="21 iosModal">Project
    Vitruvius</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="24ag3"
    class="24 iosModal">Director Haas' Pet Project</a>) from hand, or an <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="0ag0" class="0 iosModal">Advanced Concept Hopper</a> if installed a
  previous turn. The high cost will easily be recouped if you have plenty of campaigns running.
  <br>
  If a glacier server is already set up and the runner can threaten that remote, try baiting them to run by installing a
  campaign last click. If they run it, they'll waste their credits on the expensive to break bioroids while also not
  getting anything when they run headfirst into a campaign.
