  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="21id0"
    class="21 iosModal">SYNC</a> is the reason NBN is part of the big four mega corporations. This web of
  interconnectivity has made <em>everything</em> viewable from your very own PAD, including all the sneaking around the
  runner does. It is quite hard to make friends when there's a camera pointed at you in <em>every</em>. <em>single</em>.
  <em>direction</em>.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Lots of tagging capabilities, tag punishment is plentiful
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Weak if the runner can continually shake tags
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="21id0"
    class="21 iosModal">SYNC</a> <em>really</em> wants to land and keep tags on the runner. A lot of different things
  activate when the runner is tagged such as <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="8o1" class="8 iosModal">Closed Accounts</a>, <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="9o2" class="9 iosModal">Psychographics</a>, <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="16ag2" class="16 iosModal">Market Research</a>, and <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="23ag5" class="23 iosModal">Quantum Predictive Model</a>.
  <br>
  Timing when to fire a <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="2o0"
    class="2 iosModal">Hard-Hitting News</a> can really make the runner unable to shake all the tags. With <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="21id0" class="21 iosModal">SYNC</a>, it'll cost
  the runner <em>12</em> credits to get rid of 4 tags, which will almost guarantee an open scoring window for you to
  capitalize on.
  <br>
  Laying out an <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="20ag3"
    class="20 iosModal">Explode-a-palooza</a> just for the runner to score it can make for an absolutely brutal <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14o3" class="14 iosModal">Midseason
    Replacements</a> tag storm. Keep the runner tagged <em>all</em> the time and you should have no problems closing out
  the game.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Finding <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="10is1" class="10 iosModal">Data Ravens</a> in your opening hand can absolutely stop further access
  to your central servers since the runner will be scared of the upcoming tag punishment.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; If the runner decides to float tags, take advantage of <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="9o2" class="9 iosModal">Psychographics</a> and <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="6ag0" class="6 iosModal">Project Beale</a> and
  score as many points as you can afford. Sometimes it'll just straight win you the game if you're 3-4 points away by
  placing 5 or 7 advancements respectively.
  <br>
  Allowing the runner to score <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="22ag4"
    class="22 iosModal">15 Minutes</a> or <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="20ag3"
    class="20 iosModal">Explode-a-palooza</a> to later hit them with a <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14o3" class="14 iosModal">Midseason Replacements</a> is a great way to
  take over the game.
