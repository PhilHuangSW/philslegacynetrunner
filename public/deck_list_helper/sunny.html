  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="9r2"
    class="9">Underworld Contacts</a>, <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="17h3"

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="8p0"
    class="8">Snitch</a> and <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="12p1" class="12">Au
    Revoir</a> are insane together. If you're lucky enough to get all three, you can run any empty server or unrezzed
  ICE and then jack out to gain 3 credits. Doing that for all 4 clicks (5 with <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="11r3" class="11">Rachel</a>), nets you 12 credits!
