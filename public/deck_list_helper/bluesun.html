  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="25id0"
    class="25 iosModal">Blue Sun</a> is part of Weyland Consortium, notorious for blowing up problems rather than trying
  to fix them. They produce so much power and credits that they are able to make use of the toughest ICE from all the
  mega
  corporations to stop the runner from infiltrating their data. They're very "old money"; throw credits at it until
  they get exactly what they want.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Incredible credit generation, strongest ICE in the game
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; You need money to make money, <em>all</em> ICE are expensive
</p>

  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="25id0"
    class="25 iosModal">Blue Sun</a> is very classic netrunner; make a lot of credits, then rez big and strong ICE to
  keep runners out. Through their ID ability, you can guarantee <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="16ag3" class="16 iosModal">Corporate Wars</a> from firing, having enough credits for <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="13o2" class="13 iosModal">Hedge Funds</a> and
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="19o4" class="19 iosModal">Restructures</a>,
  and bouncing back <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="18a2"
    class="18 iosModal">Elizabeth Mills</a> and utilizing her people skills to remove bad publicity.
  <br>
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="6u0" class="6 iosModal">Bryan Stinson</a> is
  your best friend; use him often when the runner is low on credits so that you always have enough to rez your big and
  expensive ICE.
  <br>
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="24u1" class="24 iosModal">Will-o'-the-Wisp</a>
  will help keep runners out of your servers when you fire it at a key icebreaker. There are a lot of very expensive and
  taxing barriers in this deck, so targeting the runner's fracter is usually a good idea.
  <br>
  Be aggressive in your game plan with <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="25id0"
    class="25 iosModal">Blue Sun</a>. Find an expensive ICE to advance agendas behind of and score some early points.
  Mid game will be where you will have to set up some of your strongest ICE, then hopefully you'll be able to close it
  out by late game

<p>
  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="30ib5"
    class="30 iosModal">Spiderweb</a> is one of the cheapest ICE that can stop the runner early game. A hand full of ICE
  and credit-generating cards is always a safe keep.

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; Bouncing back <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="18a2" class="18 iosModal">Elizabeth Mills</a> to remove your bad publicity will be a good strategy
  to use. The deck can generate quite a few, so taking a couple turns removing them can really help your mid to late
  game.
  <br>
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="2a0" class="2 iosModal">Sandburg</a> can
  absolutely destroy the runner's chances of getting through your servers if you have enough credits thanks to <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="6u0" class="6 iosModal">Bryan Stinson</a>.
  <br>
  Don't be afraid of placing <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="21ib4"
    class="21 iosModal">Curtain Walls</a> early in the game if it can score you a lot of points. You can bounce it back
  later to always make use of its positional power.
  <br>
  If you have enough credits and the runner has no sentry killer, <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="22is2" class="22 iosModal">Shinobi</a> can straight up flatline the runner by itself; always check
  how much link they have before committing to your traces!
