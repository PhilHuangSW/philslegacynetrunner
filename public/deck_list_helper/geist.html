  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="iosModal 15" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="15id0">Geist</a> is a one and done kind of runner. Each program, hardware, icebreaker, and
  resource will have its use, and once he's done with it, he'll never use it again. Luckily he has a lot of things at
  his disposal.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Incredible ways to filter and burn through his deck
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Cloud icebreakers are highly dependent on each other
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="iosModal 15" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="15id0">Geist</a> is an avalanche of a runner. It takes quite a while to set up his rig, but once
  things start rolling, they <em>really</em> start rolling. A lot of his gameplay will be drawing and installing, with a
  certain point in your gameplay to be trashing the installed cards to draw with his ability, then installing,
  condensing a bit of your clicks economy.
  <br>
  Take a couple turns setting things up, such as getting some
  help from <a class="iosModal 14" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14r3">Street
    Peddlers</a>
  and <a class="iosModal 18" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="18r4">Technical
    Writers</a> to
  start filtering through your deck and gaining some economy at the same time. Once you have a couple of Cloud breakers
  (<a class="iosModal 12" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="12i3">Spike</a> - <a
    class="iosModal 13" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="13i4">Crowbar</a> - <a
    class="iosModal 17" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="17i5">Shiv</a>) or <a
    class="iosModal 11" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="11p1">Grappling Hooks</a>
  alongside an <a class="iosModal 8" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="8h2">e3
    Feedback Implants</a>, you'll
  be able to smoothly break almost anything in your way.
  <br>
  Since your rig is mostly disposable, you'll need to run smart, that is to say you must figure out the most opportune
  time to strike at a remote threatening an agenda. With the Cloud breakers, you will mostly be limited on the number of
  runs you can make a turn. However, do <em>not</em> be shy just because they are limited. With the help of <a
    class="iosModal 9" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="9e0">Levy AR Lab Access</a>
  you'll be able to
  start burning through your deck all over again.

  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Try to look for <a class="iosModal 8" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="8h2">e3 Feedback Implants</a> with some economy such as <a
    class="iosModal 0" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="0r0">Tech Traders</a> or <a
    class="iosModal 18" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="18r4">Technical
    Writers</a>.

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; Installing <a class="iosModal 1" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="1h0">Spy Cameras</a>, albeit slow, are a great way of scrying for certain cards (once you have a
  couple that is).
  <br>
  One of the best uses for <a class="iosModal 8" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="8h2">e3
    Feedback Implants</a> is against Bioroid ICE. When you spend click(s) to break their subroutines, you can then
  trigger e3 to break the rest without spending additional clicks!
