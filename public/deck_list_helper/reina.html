</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Lots of moving pieces that might rely on other pieces to work, can be a little

    class="2">Reina</a> is a sight to behold when she's firing from all cylinders. Her basic economy engine relies on
  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4r2" class="4">Professional Contacts</a>
  with the help of a couple <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="3r1"
    class="3">Liberated Accounts</a>. Setting up <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="16p3" class="16">Scheherazade</a> and <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="17h1" class="17">Deep Red</a> alongside her trusty chess pieces (<a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="13p0" class="13">Pawn</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14p1" class="14">Rook</a> - <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="15p2" class="15">Bishop</a>) is another wonderful source of economy
  while providing ICE debilitating utility for your icebreakers.

  Gameplay will involve clicking <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4r2"
    class="4">Professional Contacts</a> a couple of times then installing your pieces. Being able to install chess
  pieces onto <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="16p3" class="16">Scheherazade</a>
  then immediately moving them onto ICE via <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="17h1" class="17">Deep Red</a> is incredibly satisfying when building up your rig.

    class="4">Professional Contacts</a> and <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
