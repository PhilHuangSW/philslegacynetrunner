  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="8" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="8id0">Smoke</a> is my absolute favorite runner. She's flashy, she's cocky, she's efficient.
  Her stealth breaker suite makes running a 4-ICE deep server seem like a walk in the park.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Runs are cheap, can do crazy/flashy things like scoring <a class="14"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14e4">Notoriety</a> and taking an extra
  turn by having an <a class="12" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="12e3">Encore</a>
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Can be locked out of servers if stealth credits are spent unwisely, highly
  dependent on stealth credits
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="8" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="8id0">Smoke</a> takes a little bit of finesse to play as it's not really her game to gain a whole
  lot of credits and then run everywhere. Make use of her recurring stealth credits by making cheap runs every turn on a
  lightly defended HQ or R&D.

  Using your <a class="0" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="0r0">Patrons</a> on naked
  servers is a great way to quickly build up your rig and using <a class="1" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="1e0">Out of the Ashes</a> when you
  can afford to will be great for future turns where you are seeking to score <a class="14" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14e4">Notoriety</a> and/or to have an <a class="12"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="12e3">Encore</a>.
  <br>
  <a class="4" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4r1">Algo Trading</a> might seem
  slow (and it is), but with your recurring credits allowing you to continue running while investing your actual credits
  will help in your future turns.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; Try to look for <a class="0" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="0r0">Patron</a> and some <a class="16" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="16r4">Daily Casts</a> for your draw engine and drip economy respectively. Having <a class="5"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="5r2">Beth Kilrain-Chang</a> in your opening
  hand never hurts as well.

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; Using <a class="11" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="11e2">Cold Read</a> on naked Assets with high trash costs is a great use of a card when you're low
  on credits, and since you didn't have to use any Icebreakers, nothing will get trashed.
  <br>
  Using <a class="1" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="1e0">Out of the Ashes</a> on
  non-pressure situations can really help future you when you really need that extra run on a turn to secure the
  victory.
