  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="5" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="5id0">Khan</a> is a straight shooter. Her objectives are clear: make lots of credits and bust
  through the
  corp's defenses.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Incredible credits package, strong HQ pressure
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Icebreakers are not efficient, can burn through a large credit pool very quickly
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="5" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="5id0">Khan</a> is very straight forward in her approach. <a class="0" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="0e0">High-Stakes Job</a>, <a class="4" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4r1">Temujin Contract</a>, and <a class="14" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14r2">Bank Job</a> all generate you a boat load of credits for you to
  break through to HQ using your birds (<a class="3" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="3i0">Golden</a> - <a class="6" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="6i1">Peregrine</a> - <a class="8" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="8i2">Saker</a>).
  <br>
  There is a circular gameplan you can utilize with <a class="5" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="5id0">Khan's</a> ability, <a class="16" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="16h3">Autoscripters</a>, and the birds. When appropriate, break all the subroutines of an ICE with
  a bird, use the last paid ability of the birds to derez the ICE, use <a class="5" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="5id0">Khan's</a> ability to bring back the bird at a 1-credit
  discount, then receive your click from <a class="16" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="16h3">Autoscripter</a>. It is extremely expensive to do, but when used on a high-rez ICE, it can
  save you a lot of credits in the long run.
  <br>
  The most difficult part of playing the deck will be to find when to execute a <a class="12" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="12e2">SYN Attack</a> to maximize scoring potential. The *usual* best
  time to play <a class="12" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="12e2">SYN Attack</a>
  will be when the corp has 2-4 cards. This usually puts the corp in the most difficult positions on whether to draw or
  discard.

  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="14" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="14r2">Bank Jobs</a>, <a class="4" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="4r1">Temujin Contracts</a>, and <a class="13" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="13r3">Special Orders</a> are all good cards to keep.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; As a general rule of thumb, using any of the birds' (<a class="3" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="3i0">Golden</a> - <a class="6" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="6i1">Peregrine</a> - <a class="8" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="8i2">Saker</a>) last paid ability on a high rez cost ICE will be a
  good play. Using them when the corp is low on credits can also net you a couple of free accesses on HQ or R&D.
