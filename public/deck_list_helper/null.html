  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="1" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="1id0">Null</a> is jaded. He worked for corporations and saw firsthand all the bs they got away
  with. He has now vowed to try and burn everything the corp has built.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Ways to trash anything and <em>everything</em> the corp can build
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; No reliable way to pump up icebreakers, no good credit engine
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="1" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="1id0">Null's</a> goal is to destroy everything the corp has ever built. With the help of <a
    class="10" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="10p1">Parasite</a>, <a class="18"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="18e8">Forked</a>, <a class="19"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="19e9">Knifed</a>, and <a class="20"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="20e10">Spooned</a>, ICE will just melt away
  forcing the corp to spend and install more ICE and not being able to realize their investment.
  <br>
  Aside from ICE destruction, <a class="16" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="16e6">Wanton Destruction</a>, <a class="21" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="21p3">Gravedigger</a>, and <a class="13" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="13p2">Imp</a> all give you a way of dealing with cards that aren't normally able to be dealt with
  (such as operations) in a fairly cheap manner.
  <br>
  Break down the corp one card at a time and secure the victory once they have absolutely nothing left.

  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="9" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="9p0">Datasuckers</a> are an important piece to shore up some of <a class="1"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="1id0">Null's</a> weaknesses. <a class="6"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="6h0">Sifr</a> and the slow-growing icebreakers
  (<a class="4" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="4i0">Nfr</a> - <a class="7"
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="7i2">Sunya</a>) are also great keeps as they
  take a little while to get going.

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; <a class="13" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="13p2">Imp</a>-ing an Agenda can be a strong play sometimes when an effect triggering off scoring
  would be deadly.
  <br>
  Don't be afraid to trash your <a class="5" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="5i1">Black Orchestra</a> as its ability can still be used from the heap to bring it back into
  play.
  <br>
  Finding a time to do an <a class="14" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="14e4">Amped
    Up</a> <a class="16" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="16e6">Wanton
    Destruction</a> run is very satisfying (and sometimes game-winning) to do.
