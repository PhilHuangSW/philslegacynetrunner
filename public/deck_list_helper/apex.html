  <strong>Intro:</strong>&nbsp; No one is quite sure where <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="13id0" class="iosModal 13">Apex</a> came from, all we do know is that it is hungry, and
  <em>always</em> on
  the hunt for its next prey.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp; Everything and anything can be used as fuel
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp; Can run out of answers if the wrong cards are installed facedown
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Playstyle:</strong>&nbsp; Knowing what resources to feed <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="17i3" class="iosModal 17">Endless Hunger</a> will determine your success. Figuring out which cards
  to
  install facedown and which to use is an important skill to learn when playing <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="13id0" class="iosModal 13">Apex</a>. The <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="8i0" class="iosModal 8">Three</a> <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="9i1" class="iosModal 9">Headed</a> <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="10i2" class="iosModal 10">Cerberus</a> will help you deal with ICE
  that can't
  be handled with <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="17i3"
    class="iosModal 17">Endless
    Hunger</a>. When you've spent all the counters on the dogs, you can either use them as food or to <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="11e4" class="iosModal 11">Uninstall</a> them
  and install
  them again for fresh
  counters.

  <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="12p3" class="iosModal 12">Trope</a> and <a
    data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="2e1" class="iosModal 2">Deja Vu</a> will be
  your only
  means of recurring your used cards, use them wisely!
  <br>
  There's no multi-access unfortunately, but we do have <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="14e5" class="iosModal 14">Apocalypse</a>. Obliterate everything they own, then run amok on all
  servers
  while the corp scrambles to try and rebuild itself.

  <strong>Mulligan:</strong>&nbsp; There is no must-have card in your opening hand. <a data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="1e0" class="iosModal 1">Process Automation</a> will keep you healthy
  in credits
  and cards, while <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal" data-bs-whatever="17i3"
    class="iosModal 17">Endless
    Hunger</a> will break almost anything, so those could be good keeps.

  <strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp; Don't wait too long to use <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="14e5" class="iosModal 14">Apocalypse</a>. Using one when the corp is just starting to get into
  groove can
  <em>severely</em> hinder their agenda. Playing <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#cardModal"
    data-bs-whatever="13id0" class="iosModal 13">Apex</a> is all about tempo; never let the corp get an upper hand,
  always keep
  the pressure.
